This is a program designed to help with revision. It allows you to create revision notes, prompting you based
on the timetable you input, and then regularly suggests that you revise it, to ensure you remember it in the
long term.

Blank documents allow you to blank out parts of text, which you will then be tested on.

Fact documents have questions, and you fill in the answers.

Text documents contain text which will be shown to you on each revision. They are good for linking to external
resources.
