This is a program designed to aid revision. It can create revisionprogram.documents. In the future, it may have many types of revisionprogram.documents.
A revisionprogram.timetable system is also intended - something that allows the user to enter a revisionprogram.timetable and have the program prompt them to enter things by subject, to be conveniently filed.

This is currently entirely local and entirely desktop based - it is written in java.
